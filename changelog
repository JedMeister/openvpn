turnkey-openvpn-15.1 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Update openvpn-addclient script to current standards, include
    'remote-cert-tls server' & 'auth-nocache' - closes #1264.
    [ https://github.com/AlejandroBOFH ]

  * Refacter openvpn-addclient script to accept '--no-authcache' as an
    optional argument so 'auth-nocache' is optional rather than being forced.
